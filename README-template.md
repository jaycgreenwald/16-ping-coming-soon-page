## Overview


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I still have much to learn... but, I did:
  - use regex for the first time to validate email inputs
  - display error messages using JavaScript
  - try not to be "pixel perfect"


### Continued development

- Keep learning JavaScript
- Learn more about how to use aria attributes
- Keep learning about BEM


### Questions

- Did I use the aria attributes correctly? I need to learn a lot more about this.
- I'm still fuzzy on the times to employ min-width, max-width, or width? It works, but could it better? More flexible?
- JavaScript - is there a difference between accessing an element directly and creating a variable then referencing the variable. What about getElementById versus querySelector?


### Useful resources

- There were many, but I lost track of them.
